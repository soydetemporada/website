        To begin with, it is important to know that the rhythm of the earth is not like a clock: a harvest can be advanced or delayed depending on the weather conditions and the variety of the product. The data for each product was elaborated from the answers received by agricultors. For certain fruits and vegetables, we received few responses and it may be that the season presented is not entirely in line with the situation in all regions of the country. Therefore, we do not exclude the possibility that there are errors in the calendar.

        The good thing about this project is that you can collaborate to improve the reliability of the calendar. How to do it? Filling <a href="http://soydetemporada.es/colabora/" target="_blank"> this form</a> with the season of the products you know and the province in which they are cultivated.

          This project is a prototype in constant evolution. It started with a list of 53 common fruits and vegetables but we are going to add new products little by little. You can see the waiting list <a href="https://github.com/soydetemporada/website/issues/13" target="_blank">here</a>. If you want us to add information about a product that is not on the list, <a href="http://soydetemporada.es/contacto/" target="_blank">let us know</a>.

          Many users have asked us why the banana is not in the list. The reason is that today, the calendar only includes products that are grown in the Spanish peninsula and 99.9%* of Spanish bananas come from the Canary Islands. This project is based on the idea that consuming responsibly means eating seasonal but also eating local. For this reason, we did not want to mix data from remote territories with radically different climates. We want to draw up a calendar for seasonal products in the Canary Islands but we have not yet collected enough data on the seasons there to do so. If you are a Canarian and you want your own calendar, send the <a href="http://soydetemporada.es/colabora/"
            target="_blank">participation form</a> to all the farmers you know so that they can fill it in and we can gather enough data to set up another calendar. *Source: <a href="http://www.mapama.gob.es/es/estadistica/temas/publicaciones/anuario-de-estadistica/"

        Due to the lack of Canarian collaborators, the calendar only includes products that are cultivated in the Spanish peninsula. We would love to make a version of the calendar for the Canary Islands so if you know the natural cycle of the plants there, do not hesitate to fill in <a href="http://soydetemporada.es/colabora/" target="_blank">the form</a>.

          When this icon is displayed next to a product, it means that the product is starting or finishing its full season. The harvest of a fruit or vegetable can vary greatly depending on climatic conditions and we cannot know exactly when a product will be available. The hourglass warns that the product could still be out of season.

          Many people have asked us if we had included climate change variable in the calendar. In the current version of the project, we don't appreciate how climate changes can affect the season of products but we would love to be able to add information on the subject in the future, as well as make an article with interviews of farmers explaining how the changes are affecting them.
